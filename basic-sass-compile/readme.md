# Basic Example - Compile Sass Into CSS

This is a very simple grunt example that shows how to compile Sass files into css.

Run `npm install` and then `grunt` to try it out.

You can see how it works by reading the comments in the [Gruntfile](Gruntfile.js).

After you understand how this works you should check out the intermediate example that shows how to add watch functionality.
